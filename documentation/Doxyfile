# Doxyfile 1.8.7

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------


# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Edge of the Abyss"


# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Simple 2D obstacle avoiding game"


# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ./documentation


# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE              = YES


# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES, all private members of a class will
# be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES


# If the EXTRACT_PRIV_VIRTUAL tag is set to YES, documented private virtual
# methods of a class will be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIV_VIRTUAL   = YES


# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.
# The default value is: NO.

BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = YES
