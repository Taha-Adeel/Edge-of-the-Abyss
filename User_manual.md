To play the game "Edge of the abyss", once you build it using make, navigate to ./build and run the executable.

The objective of the game is to avoid the obstacles and complete the levels. Watch out for spikes and crashing into the sides of a wall.
You can jump over the obstacles in normal mode, fly over them in plane mode, and even have the gravity flipped. You change gamemodes by going
through different portals. If you die, you will be reset to the beginning of the level :)

The controls in the game are very simple.
* In normal mode, hold space, or the up-arrow key, or the mouse left click to jump up.
* In plane mode, holding the button will make you accelerate upwards
