To compile the project, clone it and build it using "make" command. The project uses SFML library, so you must have it installed in your system before hand. (See [this for linux](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php) and [this for others](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)). The Makefile needs to be modified if you install to a non standard path on linux, or if you are using Windows or MacOS.
